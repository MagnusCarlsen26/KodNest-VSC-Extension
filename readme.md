# Project Idea

while solving problems in Kodnest website i see that UI/UX is very slow, laggy and junky. Hence I dont want to use that. I want to create a vscode extension which will dispaly me the question, and i can write code in vscode and it will automatically submit when i am done. 

I will also be able to see if my submission is correct or not. If it is correct, I should be able to move on to next question. 

All this should happen without ever visiting Kodnext Application.
